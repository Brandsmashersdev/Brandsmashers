          `HTML5: WebRTC heavily relies on HTML5 for accessing media devices (like webcams and microphones) and for rendering video and audio streams. JavaScript: WebRTC APIs are primarily accessed and manipulated using JavaScript for establishing connections, exchanging data, and managing media streams.`,

          `WebSocket: Although not a direct part of WebRTC, WebSocket is often used in conjunction with WebRTC for signaling and establishing connections between peers.`,

          `ICE servers-  ICE is a protocol that tries to find out the best possible way to connect two agents or peers. Each ICE agent publishes its reachable known as candidates. These candidates ate nothing but the transport address of the agent to reach the other connecting agent.`,

          `STUN and TURN servers: STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) and TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) servers are used to facilitate communication between peers, especially in scenarios where direct peer-to-peer connections are not possible due to network configurations.`,

          `It is in demand in many industry verticals because of an ascent in its application in end-use parts. There has also been an expansion in the quantity of WebRTC clients in the versatile application. E-commerce, telecom, IT, web-based businesses, etc. are making great use of the technology. It is an open-source API and is effectively accessible to application engineers. WebRTC does not depend upon the steps and device on which it is coordinated. This pulls in worldwide clients.`,
          `WebRTC reduces the time needed and makes the process easy even for a non-technical user as it requires no plug-in, frameworks, or applications. To establish a connection for data transfer, the browsers work Session Description Protocol (SDP). WebRTC uses JavaScript Application Programming Interface (APIs) and HTML5 for embedded communication within the browsers.`,
          `The global WebRTC market is segmented on a different basis – components, vertices,  industry verticals, and regional/country level.`,
          `The major factor driving the growth of the WebRTC market worldwide is the increasing number of Internet users. As per the Our World Data, global internet users increased from only 413 million in 2000 to over 3.4 billion in 2016. There will be 6 billion Internet users by 2022 (around 75 percent of the world population) and more than 7.5 billion Internet users by 2030, predicts Cybersecurity Ventures. `,
          `The growth of the global WebRTC market is facilitated by technological advancement in the communication vertical. Increasing adoption of voice and video calling and conferencing in the application is expected to boost the market growth. For instance, popular apps like Snapchat utilize WebRTC to control their video calling highlight. `

        title: `What is an ArrayBuffer?`,
        description: `An ArrayBuffer is a fixed-length binary data buffer in memory. It represents a generic,
        fixed-length raw binary data buffer, which can be used to store data such as integers,
        floating-point numbers, or even custom data structures in a contiguous block of memory.
        Unlike arrays in JavaScript, which can dynamically resize as elements are added or
        removed, an ArrayBuffer has a fixed size upon creation and cannot be resized. This fixed
        size property makes ArrayBuffer particularly useful in scenarios where predictable memory
        allocation and efficient data handling are paramount.
        `
      },
      {
        title: `How does it work?`,
        description: `Internally, an ArrayBuffer is essentially a block of memory whose contents can be
        accessed and manipulated through typed array views or DataView objects. Typed arrays
        provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data in memory and interpreting it as specific
        numeric data types, such as integers or floating-point numbers, while DataView objects allow
        for more flexible access to the raw binary data.
        When you create an ArrayBuffer, you specify the number of bytes it should allocate. This
        allocated memory space remains fixed throughout the lifetime of the ArrayBuffer instance.
        `
      },
      {
        title: `Significance in Modern Programming`,
        description: `Efficient Data Manipulation: ArrayBuffer provides a more efficient and
        direct way to work with binary data compared to traditional JavaScript
        arrays. This efficiency is particularly crucial in performance-sensitive
        applications, such as graphics processing, network protocols, and data
        processing tasks.
        Interoperability: ArrayBuffer facilitates interoperability between different
        programming environments and languages. Since binary data is a
        common format for communication between systems, ArrayBuffer
        enables seamless integration between JavaScript-based web
        applications and lower-level languages like C++ or Rust.
        Data Serialization: ArrayBuffer is often used as the underlying data structure for serialising
        and deserializing complex data structures. By serialising data into binary format and storing
        it in an ArrayBuffer, developers can efficiently transmit, store, and reconstruct data across
        different platforms and environments.
        `
      },
      {
        title: `Example Usage`,
        description: `Javascript code
        let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);
        // Creating a DataView to manipulate the binary data
        let view = new DataView(buffer);
        // Writing a 32-bit signed integer to the buffer at offset 0
        view.setInt32(0, 42);
        // Reading the integer back from the buffer
        let value = view.getInt32(0);
        console.log(value); // Output: 42

        In this example, we create an ArrayBuffer with a fixed size of 16 bytes. We then create a
        DataView object to manipulate the binary data within the buffer. Finally, we write a 32-bit
        signed integer to the buffer at offset 0 and read it back to verify the operation.
        `

        title: `Conclusion`,
        description: `ArrayBuffer is a fundamental data structure that plays a vital role in
        efficient data handling and manipulation in modern programming. Its
        fixed-size, raw binary data representation makes it invaluable for
        scenarios where predictable memory allocation and direct data access
        are essential. Understanding how to use and leverage ArrayBuffer
        effectively can greatly enhance the performance and efficiency of your
